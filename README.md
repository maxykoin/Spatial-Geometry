# Spatial Geometry 2.0 (171223)
With this program you'll be able to calculate the area and volume of 4 different solids: pyramids, cones, cylinders and spheres. It supports undisclosed square root values (like √3) and undisclosed π value, using the [sympy library](https://docs.sympy.org). If any bugs or erros happen please report it to me!

This is a passion project, made to test my python knowledge and double feautures as an attempt to memorize the formulas for a math exam.

## How to use 
- Download the *geometry.py* file
``` bash
pip install sympy
```
- Have fun!

## What I Learned
- Better understading of while loops
- Problem solving 
- Better nested Ifs
- Better variable naming 
- Memorized some formulas for my exam :]
- Learnt more about de Sympy library
### Version 2.0:
- match...case
- Functions
- Code optimization
