# Spatial Geometry
With this program you'll be able to calculate the area and volume of 5 different solids: pyramids cones, cylinders, spheres, and polygons.

It's an unser input through the cmd based program, if any bugs or erros happen please report it me! This was a passion project to test my python knowledge and an attempt to memorize the formulas for my math exam, I tried to make it as complex as possible based on my knowledge of python (and math) to this point in my apprenticeship (at the time of uploading my first commit) of just one week. 

## What I Learned
- Better understading of while loops
- Problem solving 
- Better nested Ifs
- Better variable naming 
- Memorized some formulas for my exam :]
